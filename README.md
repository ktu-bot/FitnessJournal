An example of text with **bold** and *italic* fonts. 

This journal will be able to track you total daily macronutrient intake and different gym lifts. The main purpose for this application was to help me stay on track of keeping my diet by visualizing caloric intake over time. You will also be able to look back at the macronutrient (calories, protein, carbohydrates, fats) intake and exercises done for any day. Tracking exercises can be done through inputting the name, weight, sets, and reps. There is no limit to the amount of anything you can add, and if any of the fields feel excessive, feel free to leave it blank and it will be tracked as 0.

As with any journal, this application is meant for self growth and development. Which is why the visualizing component aids in leading you towards your goal. Remember to save your progress or reset it if it's overflowing!
